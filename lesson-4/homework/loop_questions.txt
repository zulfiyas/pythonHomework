1. difference between continue and break: Break: exits the loop completely when a certain condition is met. Continue: skips the current iteration and moves to the next one. 
2. For loop iterates over a sequence and while loop runs as long as the condition remains. 
for loop automatically stops when the sequence ends and while loop requires manual control to avoid infinite loops.
3. A nested loop means a loop inside another loop. It is often used for working with matrices or multi-level iterations.
Example:
for i in range(3):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(3):  # Inner loop
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
